VILT stack template app for PHP 8.2.x|8.3.x created by Musimana. Features include server-side rendering (SSR) and Larastan, Pest & Dusk test suites.

### Backwards Compatibility

Since the repo is offered as a template, it is offered on the basis that once an instance of it has been generated,
there will be no attempts to maintain backwards compatibility between the instance and this repo.
This means you are free to use the generated instance however you wish,
but that there is no native mechanism for updating any given instance to match later versions of this template repository.

For more info on this see the [Versioning Policy](.docs/RELEASE.md#versioning-policy).
