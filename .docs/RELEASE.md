# RELEASE PROCESS

New versions are named in accordance with the [SemVer](http://semver.org/) conventions, and are identified by tagged releases on the repository.
A new tag is created for each release with the new tag and the title of the release in the format `v1.0.0`, where the digits indicate the SemVer version.
The convention is to use the generated release notes feature, with pre-releases marked as appropriate.
